# Percolation
A project written in Python that simulates percolation on a 2D lattice. The simulation uses coloring algorithms to identify and analyze the behavior of the infinite cluster at varying percolation probabilities. The results include visual graphs of the infinite cluster formation and statistical analysis of percolation thresholds. Additionally, the project generates graphs showing the distribution of cluster sizes and the evolution of the infinite cluster as the percolation probability increases.
